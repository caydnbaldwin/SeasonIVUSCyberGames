# SeasonIVUSCyberGames
Season IV US Cyber Games. I placed 408th out of 1353 competitors. The beginner's gameroom lasted 10 days while the open competition lasted a week.

## Experience
This was my favorite CTF yet. I solved 7 beginner challenges and 1 open challenge. I almost solved multiple more challenges but got caught on the last step for each of them.
